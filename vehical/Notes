Need to add the ability to shrink a polygon, that is bring its dimensions in by some amount.
Since most mapped polygons show the border of an object like a lake or river, and the routing scheme will often follow the edge of
the polygon, we cant really follow the edge of the waterway.


Currenly non-closed polygons are being closed. I think it is in the way the routing algorthim looks at polygons where it assumes the fist
and last points are connected, ie only three points are needed to make a square.
Should change this to where it is not assumed. The ways from openstreet map will have first/last points be the same if they are closed.
Then we can look at non-closed polygons as possible routes.

Also there is an issue where an outline of a river may be closed at some point on the river, and then start again with a new polygon, or
that may be the end of where the bank was mapped. Assuming the river center is mapped, this could be discovered by a point where the polygon
and the line of the river cross.
This will also be the case when/if changing body's of water, from lake to river, or river to river. I think the way past this is to
see where two polygons share two adjacent points, this would indicate it is a passable transition.


Need to be able to convert tile information into a polygon. Guessing this is going to be some sort of cv algorithm to find
